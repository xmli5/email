# The XMLi5 Email

This thing is designed to be bulletproof.

- It uses percentages to ensure that the email is reasonably responsive without relying on hacks and unreliable tricks.

- It works without a DOCTYPE, and is supplied with the XHTML1 Transitional DOCTYPE for reliability between the few clients that don't strip the DOCTYPE.

- It uses only `table`,`tr` and `td` elements and `align`/`valign` attributes for layout.
